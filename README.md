creating a basic neural network using pytorch framework 

A neural network is a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It is composed of layers of interconnected "neurons," which process and transmit information.

Here's a brief overview of how a neural network works:

Input layer: The input layer receives the input data and passes it on to the hidden layers.

Hidden layers: The hidden layers process the input data using weights and biases, which are learned parameters that are adjusted during the training process. The hidden layers may also include activation functions, which transform the input data in a certain way.

Output layer: The output layer produces the final output of the neural network, based on the processing of the input data by the hidden layers.

Training: To train a neural network, you need a dataset and a set of labeled output values. The neural network is then presented with the input data and the corresponding output values, and the weights and biases are adjusted to minimize the error between the predicted output values and the actual output values. This process is repeated until the neural network is able to accurately predict the output values for the input data.

Inference: Once the neural network is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen input data. The input data is passed through the input layer, processed by the hidden layers, and produces an output at the output layer.

Neural networks are powerful machine learning models that can learn complex patterns and relationships in data. They are used in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and even playing games.
